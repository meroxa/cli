	Long: `use the connect commands to automatically configure the connections
		   required to pull data from one datasource (the source) to another
		   (the target).

		   this is essentially a shortcut for creating a connection from the
		   source to Meroxa and creating a connection from Meroxa to the target`,

	// Subcommands
	connectCmd.Flags().String("to", "", "resource name")
	connectCmd.MarkFlagRequired("to")

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// connectCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// connectCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
