We believe that anyone should be empowered to leverage real-time data. Using the Meroxa CLI, you can build data infrastructure in minutes not months.

## Documentation

Meroxa is documented publicly in https://docs.meroxa.com/, but on each build we also generate Markdown files for each command, exposing the available commands and help for each one. Check it out at [docs/cmd/md/meroxa](docs/cmd/md/meroxa.md).

## Contributing

For a complete guide to contributing to the Meroxa CLI, see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation Guide

Please follow the installation instructions in the [Meroxa Documentation](http://docs.meroxa.com/).

### Build and Install the Binaries from Source (Advanced Install)

Currently, we provide pre-built Meroxa binaries for macOS (Darwin) Windows, and Linux architectures.

See [Releases](https://github.com/meroxa/cli/releases).

If you run into any issues during compiling the binaries, checkout the [troubleshooting guide](#troubleshooting).

Prerequisite Tools:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

To build from source:

1. The CLI depends on [meroxa-go](github.com/meroxa/meroxa-go) (which is currently a private repo). To update vendoring the dependency, you'll need to run the following:

```
make gomod
```

2. Build CLI as `meroxa` binary:

```
make build
```

## Release

A [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser) GitHub Action is
configured to automatically build the CLI and cut a new release whenever a new
git tag is pushed to the repo.

* Tag - `git tag -a vX.X.X -m "<message goes here>"`
* Push - `git push origin vX.X.X`

With every release, a new Homebrew formula will be automatically updated on [meroxa/homebrew-taps](https://github.com/meroxa/homebrew-taps).

## Linting

If you want to make sure everything's correct before pushing to GitHub, you'll need to install [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run/) and run:

```
$ golangci-lint run
```

Example:

```
‚ùØ golangci-lint run
cmd/display.go:60:6: `appendCell` is unused (deadcode)
func appendCell(cells []*simpletable.Cell, text string) []*simpletable.Cell {
     ^
```

## Tests

To run the test suite:

```
make test
```

## Shell Completion

If you want to enable shell completion manually, you can generate your own using our `meroxa completion` command.

Type `meroxa help completion` for more information, or simply take a look at our [documentation](docs/cmd/md/meroxa_completion.md).

## Troubleshooting

### make gomod

#### Error: fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled

If you have already setup your access to `meroxa` repositories via [SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
you can enforce the download of the required dependencies listed in the [go.mod file](https://github.com/meroxa/cli/blob/master/go.mod) via `ssh` instead
of `https` to circumvent this error.

To do so, setup your `gitconfig`, by running:

```
git config --global url."git@github.com:".insteadOf "https://github.com"
```

Verify the correct setup, by running ` cat ~/.gitconfig`. You should see the following output:

```
[user]
	name = Jane Doe
	email = janedoe@gmail.com
[url "git@github.com:"]
	insteadOf = https://github.com
```

Run the `make gomod` command again, and you should see all depedencies being downloaded successfully.
